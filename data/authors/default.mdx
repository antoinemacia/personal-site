Bonjour!

I'm Antoine, a Melbourne (AU) based software engineer, tech strategist, eternal student, wannabee writter and avid reader.

I love to read and talk about AI & XR engineering and ethics, software craftsmanship and leadership, business and product strategy and the making of great teams and org cultures

I'm currently tech director at [PHORIA](https://www.phoria.com.au/) & [CAPTUR3D](https://captur3d.io/), a first-class immersive technology studio and digital twin platform who works hard on extending reality and pushing the enveloppe of what's feasible
