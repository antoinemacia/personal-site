Heya!

I'm Antoine, a Melbourne (AU) based software engineering leader, tech strategist, wannabee writter and avid reader.

I'm passionate in sociology, psychology, AI & XR engineering and ethics, software craftsmanship and leadership, and the making of great teams and org cultures

I'm currently tech director at [PHORIA](https://www.phoria.com.au/) & [CAPTUR3D](https://captur3d.io/), a first-class immersive technology studio and [digital twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) platform who works hard on extending reality and pushing the enveloppe of what's feasible
