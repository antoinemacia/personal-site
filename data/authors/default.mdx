👋 Hi there! I'm Antoine (🐜 + 1️⃣), currently Tech (Software engineering) director @ PHORIA, with a long running and ever deepening love for people, programming and learning new things.

I love to read and talk about AI & XR engineering and ethics, software craftsmanship and leadership, business and product strategy and the making of great teams and org cultures

I'm currently tech director at [PHORIA](https://www.phoria.com.au/) & [CAPTUR3D](https://captur3d.io/), a first-class immersive technology studio and digital twin platform who works hard on extending reality and pushing the virtual enveloppe (email?)
